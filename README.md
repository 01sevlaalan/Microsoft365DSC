# Office365DSC

This module allows organizations to automate the deployment, configuration, and monitoring of Office 365 Tenants via PowerShell Desired State Configuration. The compiled configuration needs to be executed from an agent's Local Configuration Manager (LCM) (machine or container) which can communicate back remotely to Office 365 via remote API calls (therefore requires internet connectivity).
