## Why Microsoft365DSC?

Microsoft365DSC allows you to write your Cloud configuration as Code, automate the deployment of that configuration, and ensures the monitoring of that configuration, notifying and acting on detected drifts. It also allows you to extract a configuration out of any existing Microsoft 365 tenant and import into another. The tool covers all major Microsoft 365 workloads such as Exchange Online, Teams, Power Platform, SharePoint, Security and Compliance.

## Export your configuration

Microsoft365DSC allows you to replicate configurations over Microsoft 365 Tenants, or to keep multiple Tenants in sync configuration wise.

## Compare your configuration against Best Practices

Microsoft365DSC can compare the configuration of your current tenant against a set of best practices (called a Blueprint) that are recommended by Microsoft and the Community. It will recommend why you need to change a setting and how to configure them in a certain way.
